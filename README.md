# C model for the lift generation of an airfoil

## Introduction

This solution describes a C model for the lift generation of an airfoil using Bernoulli's equation.

The Bernoulli equation has been used to create a simple model of lift generation of an airfoil as a function of the airfoil’s geometry, the pressure, density, and velocity of fluid around the airfoil, and other parameters such as elevation.

This model implemented as a C program. Other parameters included are the wind speed as calculated by a Pitot tube, ambient temperature, humidity, and elevation to determine the value of air density at a given elevation.

The C-based model has been tested on the Signaloid Cloud Developer Platform. This model uses the LibUncertain API to allow the model to interact with the uncertainty-tracking Signaloid C0 processor to inject distributions for those model parameters which are uncertain.

Refer to the below section for a quick reference to Bernoulli's equation.

## Bernoulli's equation

Bernoulli's equation is a fundamental principle in fluid dynamics that relates the pressure, velocity, and elevation of a fluid flowing along a streamline. It describes the conservation of energy for an ideal, incompressible fluid.

Bernoulli's equation can be written as:

> P + 0.5 \* ρ \* v^2 + ρ \* g \* h = constant

Where:

P is the pressure of the fluid.
ρ is the density of the fluid.
v is the velocity of the fluid.
g is the acceleration due to gravity.
h is the height or elevation of the fluid.
